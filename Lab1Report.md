## cd command with no arguments
![Image](cdwnoarg.png)

* The working directory was home when the cd command with no argument was run.

* It returns me to the home directory. I got this output because the cd command is used to change the current directory to the other directory that we want so it doesn't change it if we don't give an argument.

* The output is not an error.
